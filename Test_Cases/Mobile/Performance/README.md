# 📱 Mobile Performance – QA Module

This module focuses on performance-related aspects of mobile applications, including load testing and battery consumption analysis. It helps ensure that apps remain responsive, efficient, and energy-conscious across devices.

---

## 🎯 Scope

- 🚀 Load testing for app responsiveness under stress  
- 🔋 Battery consumption tracking during typical and edge-case usage  
- 📊 Performance profiling for startup time, memory usage, and UI lag  

---

### ⛔ Out of Scope

- **Web performance testing** – not included in this module  
- **Desktop performance profiling** – outside mobile scope  
- **Network throttling scenarios** – covered in [Network Throttling](../Network%20Throttling/Network_Throttling_TestCases.md)

| [`Load_Test.md`](./Load_Test.md)                  | Test Cases    | Scenarios for stress testing app performance           |
| [`Battery_Consumption.md`](./Battery_Consumption.md) | Test Cases    | Steps to measure and validate battery usage efficiency |

---

## ✅ Best Practices Covered

- Simulate high user load and monitor app responsiveness  
- Track battery drain across different usage patterns  
- Profile app startup time and memory footprint  
- Validate performance on low-end and high-end devices  
- Avoid excessive background activity and wake locks  

---

## 🛠️ Usage

These test cases are designed for manual execution and profiling during performance QA runs.  
They can be integrated into pre-release regression or executed as standalone performance audits.

## 📌 Contribution Guidelines

1. Use consistent naming: `Load_Test.md`, `Battery_Consumption.md`  
2. Structure each file with metadata, steps, expected results  
3. Keep descriptions clear and actionable  
4. Align with the rest of the QA Portfolio formatting
