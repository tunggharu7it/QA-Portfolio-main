✅ Mobile Performance – Load Test Cases

⚠️ Note: These test cases are examples. Real-world implementations may differ by project structure, naming, or QA process.

---

🎯 Scope  
These mobile test cases cover:  
- 🚀 App launch under background load  
- 🔄 Screen transition responsiveness  
- 🧮 Concurrent API handling  
- 📊 UI responsiveness and render stability  
- 🧠 Memory and CPU monitoring during heavy interaction

⛔ Out of Scope  
- Battery usage – see [Battery_Consumption.md](./Battery_Consumption.md)  
- Network throttling – covered in Connectivity module  
- Crash recovery – handled under Stability test suite
