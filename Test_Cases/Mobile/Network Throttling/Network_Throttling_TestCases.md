✅ Mobile Connectivity – Network Throttling Test Cases

⚠️ Note: These test cases are examples. Implementation depends on available tooling and project architecture.

---

🎯 Scope  
These mobile test cases cover:  
- 📶 Reduced bandwidth scenarios (2G, 3G, throttled Wi-Fi)  
- 🛰️ Offline detection and fallback behavior  
- 🔄 Retry logic and sync failure handling  
- 📡 Network switching and reconnection flows  
- 📲 Handling unstable Wi-Fi and mid-transaction drops

⛔ Out of Scope  
- Battery usage – see [Battery_Consumption.md](../Performance/Battery_Consumption.md)  
- Security – see Connectivity_Security.md  
- Crash handling – part of Stability module
