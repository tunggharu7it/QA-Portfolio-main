# 🌐 Mobile Connectivity – Network Throttling Scenarios

This module contains manual test cases focused on mobile app behavior under degraded or unstable network conditions. It helps validate responsiveness, error handling, and fallback mechanisms when bandwidth is limited or interrupted.

---

## 🎯 Scope

- 📶 App performance under reduced bandwidth (2G, 3G, throttled Wi-Fi)
- 🛰️ Offline detection and fallback behavior
- 🔄 Sync errors and retry logic with unstable connection
- 🧠 UI feedback during network degradation
- 📡 Transition between network types (Wi-Fi ↔ LTE)

---

### ⛔ Out of Scope

- Battery usage impact – see [Battery_Consumption.md](../Performance/Battery_Consumption.md)  
- Security of network traffic – handled in Connectivity_Security.md  
- Crash recovery – covered in Stability module

## ✅ Best Practices Covered

- Detect and gracefully handle offline or slow connections  
- Provide clear UI feedback during sync or load delays  
- Avoid infinite spinners or silent failures  
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff  
- Cache critical data for offline access when possible

## 🛠️ Usage

These test cases are designed for manual execution using network simulation tools (e.g. Charles Proxy, Android Emulator, iOS Network Link Conditioner).  
They can be integrated into regression cycles or executed as part of release readiness audits.
