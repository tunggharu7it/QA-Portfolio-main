# 📱 Mobile Test Suite Overview

This section includes structured test cases for mobile applications, grouped by quality assurance domains. Each module is organized into its own folder and covers accessibility, performance, adaptability, network behavior, authentication, and security validations across Android and iOS platforms.

---

> ⚠️ **Note**: These test cases are provided as reference samples. Different teams may follow different conventions for structure, naming, and scope. The examples here reflect one possible approach and are not intended to be universal.
