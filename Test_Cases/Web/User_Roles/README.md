# 👥 User Roles – Test Module Overview

This folder contains test cases related to role-based access control (RBAC) across the application. The goal is to verify that users with different roles have access only to the features and actions permitted by their assigned privileges.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The test cases in this repository are provided as examples only. Each software project may have its own conventions regarding test case structure, required fields, naming formats, documentation standards, and writing style. These samples reflect one possible approach and are not intended as the only correct format.

## 📋 Structure

- 🛡️ [Admin_Access.md](./Admin_Access.md) – tests for administrator access to management panels, configuration, and elevated features  
- 👤 [User_Access.md](./User_Access.md) – tests for regular users accessing general features within permitted boundaries

## 🎯 Scope

Test cases cover:

- Role-based access enforcement
- Permission boundaries and escalation prevention
- UI visibility based on role
- Feature availability per user type
- Unauthorized action handling

🧪 These tests ensure strong separation of privileges and reduce the risk of security flaws from misconfigured access controls.
