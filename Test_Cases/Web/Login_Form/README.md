# 🔐 Login_Form – Test Module Overview

This folder contains all test cases related to user authentication via the login form. The goal is to ensure reliable access control, proper input validation, consistent UX, and resilience against edge scenarios and vulnerabilities.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The test cases in this repository are provided as examples only. Each software project may have its own conventions regarding test case structure, required fields, naming formats, documentation standards, and writing style. These samples reflect one possible approach and are not intended as the only correct format.

## 📋 Structure

- ✅ [Login_Positive.md](./Login_Positive.md) – valid credentials and expected successful logins  
- ❌ [Login_Negative.md](./Login_Negative.md) – invalid credentials, validation errors, blocked access, and security enforcement  
- 🧠 [Login_Edge_Cases.md](./Login_Edge_Cases.md) – non-obvious login flows (e.g., input formatting, session anomalies, clipboard behavior, post-password change)

---

## 🎯 Scope

Test cases in this module cover:

- ✏️ **Field validation** – structure, required fields, formatting and edge input cases  
- 🔐 **Authentication logic** – valid and invalid login attempts, various auth flows (SSO, magic link, token, mobile)  
- 🛡️ **Security defenses** – rate limiting, lockout, expired/locked credentials, generic error messaging  
- 📲 **Usability** – copy-paste behavior, email casing tolerance, whitespace trimming  
- 🔁 **Session handling** – auto-login, re-login, token refresh, cross-tab/session flows  
- 🌐 **UI behavior** – button states, loader visibility, page redirects  
- 🌍 **Localization** – error message clarity and adaptability to locale

### ⛔ Out of Scope

- Login-related attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, token tampering) — covered in `Login_Security.md`  
- Registration, password recovery and MFA flows — handled in separate modules
