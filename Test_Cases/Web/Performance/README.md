# 🚀 Performance – Test Module Overview

This folder contains test cases focused on evaluating the performance and responsiveness of the application under various load conditions. Although traditionally executed via automation tools, these test cases are adapted for manual QA workflows to simulate and observe system behavior during high usage scenarios.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The test cases in this repository are provided as examples only. Each software project may have its own conventions regarding test case structure, required fields, naming formats, documentation standards, and writing style. These samples reflect one possible approach and are not intended as the only correct format.

## 📋 Structure

- 📊 [Load_Test.md](./Load_Test.md) – test cases for simulating typical user load
- 💥 [Stress_Test.md](./Stress_Test.md) – test cases for pushing the system beyond expected limits

## 🎯 Scope

Test cases cover:

- Page load time and responsiveness
- UI behavior under concurrent usage
- Resource consumption and bottlenecks
- Graceful degradation under stress
- Manual simulation of load scenarios

> These tests are designed for manual execution using browser tools, multiple sessions, and observation techniques.
