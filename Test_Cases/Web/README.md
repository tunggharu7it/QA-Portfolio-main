# 🌐 Web Test Suite Overview

This section contains structured test cases for the web application, grouped by functional modules. Each module is organized into its own folder and includes positive and negative scenarios, edge-case handling, accessibility and compatibility checks, performance testing, session management, and security validations.

---

> ⚠️ **Note**: The test cases in this repository are provided as examples only. Each software project may have its own conventions regarding test case structure, required fields, naming formats, documentation standards, and writing style. These samples reflect one possible approach and are not intended as the only correct format.

## 🧪 Execution Strategy

All test cases are written for **manual execution**, but follow a consistent format to support automation readiness:
- Clear steps and expected results  
- Metadata (priority, type, estimate, references)  
- Isolation-friendly structure for CI/CD integration
