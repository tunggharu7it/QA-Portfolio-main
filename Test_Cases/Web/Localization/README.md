# 🌍 Localization & Internationalization – Test Module Overview

This folder contains test cases that verify the application's ability to adapt to different languages, regions, and cultural conventions. It covers both **localization (L10n)** — adapting content for specific locales — and **internationalization (I18n)** — designing the system to support multiple locales and languages.

---

## 🎯 Scope

Test cases in this module cover:

- 🌐 **Language adaptation** – UI translation, message localization, pluralization, and encoding  
- 🧭 **Regional formats** – date/time, currency, number separators, address and phone formats  
- 🖥️ **Layout behavior** – RTL support, text expansion, font fallback, mirroring  
- 🧪 **Internationalization readiness** – pseudolocalization, Unicode support, locale switching  
- 📋 **Cultural sensitivity** – symbols, colors, legal disclaimers, and region-specific content

## 📋 Structure

- 🈶 [Localization_Test_Cases.md](./Localization_Test_Cases.md) – language-specific behavior, formatting, and UI adaptation

> 📌 All test cases follow a consistent format with metadata, steps, postconditions, and expected results.  
> 🧪 Designed for manual execution, but automation-ready.
