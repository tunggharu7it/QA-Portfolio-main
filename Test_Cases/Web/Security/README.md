# 🛡️ Security – Test Module Overview

This folder contains test cases focused on validating the security of input fields, authentication flows, and user interactions. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other attack vectors that may compromise system integrity.

> ⚠️ **Note**: The test cases in this repository are provided as examples only. Each software project may have its own conventions regarding test case structure, required fields, naming formats, documentation standards, and writing style. These samples reflect one possible approach and are not intended as the only correct format.

## 📋 Structure

- 🧨 [SQL_Injection.md](./SQL_Injection.md) – test cases for SQL injection attempts and input sanitization
- 🕷️ [XSS_Attack.md](./XSS_Attack.md) – test cases for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

## 🎯 Scope

Test cases cover:

- Input sanitization and escaping
- Error handling for malicious payloads
- Protection against unauthorized data access
- UI behavior under attack conditions
- Logging and alerting of suspicious activity

> These tests are designed for manual execution but follow a structure that supports automation readiness.
