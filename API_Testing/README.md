# üîå API Testing

## Overview

This folder contains documentation for manual API testing performed on various endpoints. It includes example requests, testing strategies, and reusable reference notes. All requests and validations are described in Markdown and reflect common practices used in QA portfolios.

## üìÅ Available Request Files

This folder includes categorized `.md` files with manual API requests organized by HTTP method. Each file contains examples and notes for:

- Authentication and session validation  
- Data creation, retrieval, and deletion  
- Header and payload formatting  
- Common error scenarios and edge cases

List of available request files:

- [GET_Requests.md](GET_Requests.md) - read operations, pagination testing, query parameters  
- [POST_Requests.md](POST_Requests.md) - resource creation, field validation, authentication flow  
- [PUT_Requests.md](PUT_Requests.md) - full object replacement, structure and status checks  
- [DELETE_Requests.md](DELETE_Requests.md) - safe deletion handling, token validation, conflict responses

| **PATCH**  | Partially update a resource      | Change only email address  |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource                | Delete a product           |
