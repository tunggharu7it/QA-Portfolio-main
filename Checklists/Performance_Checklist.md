# ðŸš€ Performance Checklist

This checklist helps assess how well the product performs under different conditions across Web and Mobile platforms. It targets responsiveness, stability, resource usage, and user experience under load. These checks support pre-release optimization and ongoing performance QA.

## âš¡ Load & Response Time

- [ ] Page/screen load time under 2 seconds for main flows  
- [ ] API calls respond within expected latency thresholds  
- [ ] Database queries complete within acceptable timeframes  
- [ ] No blocking or freezing during interactions  
- [ ] Lazy loading works without delays or layout shifts  
- [ ] Third-party content loads asynchronously without impacting UX

## ðŸ“± Device Resource Usage

- [ ] Battery consumption remains stable during usage  
- [ ] App does not overheat device under normal load  
- [ ] RAM usage stays within platform-recommended limits  
- [ ] CPU spikes are minimal during intensive actions  
- [ ] Background processes do not drain resources  
- [ ] App does not keep device awake unnecessarily

## ðŸ“¡ Network Conditions

- [ ] App handles slow connections gracefully  
- [ ] UX remains usable on 3G or poor Wi-Fi  
- [ ] Offline mode displays appropriate messages or fallback views  
- [ ] No data loss occurs during brief disconnections  
- [ ] Features that require real-time sync show error handling  
- [ ] Network timeouts and retries are properly handled

## ðŸ“¦ Application Stability

- [ ] App does not crash under normal or repeated usage  
- [ ] Memory leaks are not observed during long sessions  
- [ ] Transitions between screens/pages are smooth  
- [ ] Animations do not impact performance or responsiveness  
- [ ] App startup completes within acceptable duration  
- [ ] No deadlocks or freezing under edge interactions

## ðŸ“Š Stress & Scalability Checks

- [ ] App can support simultaneous user sessions (targeted volume)  
- [ ] High-frequency actions do not degrade performance  
- [ ] Large datasets are handled efficiently  
- [ ] Bulk upload or download does not stall or fail  
- [ ] Multiple API requests execute without race conditions  
- [ ] Load balancers or caching mechanisms are properly configured
