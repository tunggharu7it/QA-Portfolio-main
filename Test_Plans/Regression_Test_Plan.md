# üîÅ Regression Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This regression test plan defines the process for validating system stability after new code changes. It helps mitigate the risk of unintended side effects, ensuring that existing features remain functional and unaffected.  

Regression testing is aligned with quality expectations set by stakeholders and contributes to product readiness for release.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Validate the integrity of core functionality across platforms and devices  
- Confirm that no new defects have been introduced after bug fixes or enhancements  
- Provide stakeholders with a test summary that reflects business-critical areas  
- Align test effort with EngX delivery principles ‚Äî fast feedback, risk-based coverage, traceable results  

---

## 3. Test Scope

### ‚úÖ In Scope

- Functional areas impacted by code changes  
- Shared components and high-usage workflows  
- Integration points with 3rd-party services (e.g., analytics, payments, backend APIs)  
- Localization verification (if applicable)  
- Visual consistency across supported devices  

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

- Performance and load testing  
- Usability assessments  
- Exploratory sessions (covered separately)  
- Beta-specific or staging-only features not part of current release

---

## 4. Entry Criteria

- Feature development completed and merged to main branch  
- QA environment deployed with tagged build  
- Smoke testing passed successfully  
- Test data prepared or migrated  
- Defect triage completed for previously reported bugs

---

## 5. Exit Criteria

- All high- and critical-priority test cases executed  
- No open critical or blocker defects  
- All planned defects either resolved or approved for deferral  
- Test summary reviewed by QA lead and shared with project stakeholders  
- Product Owner confirms release readiness

---

## 6. Test Approach

### 6.1 Methodology

- Manual execution using pre-defined test suites  
- Risk-based prioritization across feature modules  
- Use of traceability matrix (RTM) to link test cases to user stories and acceptance criteria  
- Retesting failed test cases and confirming defect fixes  
- Selective validation on different OS versions and browsers  

### 6.2 Toolset

- **Test Case Management:** TestRail  
- **Defect Tracking:** Jira  
- **Execution & Evidence:** Device Farm, BrowserStack, Screenshot Logger  
- **Reports:** RTM coverage reports, sprint-wise execution metrics

## 7. Test Coverage Strategy

All critical flows are grouped and mapped based on functional modules:

| Area                     | Coverage Type      | Priority  |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Authentication           | Functional, Smoke   | High      |
| Checkout & Payments      | Regression, Risk    | Critical  |
| Profile & Settings       | UI, Config-based    | Medium    |
| Analytics Integration    | API, Edge Case      | High      |
| Multi-device Rendering   | Visual Regression   | Medium    |

Coverage is tracked in RTM via links between test cases and acceptance criteria defined in user stories.

---

## 8. Reporting & Metrics

Test results are captured daily in TestRail with status breakdown:

- üìà Pass Rate  
- ‚ùó Failed Tests  
- üêû Defects Logged  
- üß™ Retests Completed  
- üîó RTM Gaps (if any)

Final report includes:

- Summary table of executed test runs  
- Screenshots or logs attached to relevant tests  
- Defect list exported from Jira with status and severity  
- QA sign-off checklist  

Reports are shared via Confluence page or exported as PDF depending on stakeholder preference.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                | Mitigation Strategy                            |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Late code delivery                  | Shift regression scope to modular execution     |
| Test environment instability        | Use backup environment or local build           |
| Test case gaps                      | Expand checklist-based coverage manually        |
| Resource overlap with other streams | Assign parallel execution & priority buckets    |

---

## 10. Review & Approval

Regression test plan is reviewed and approved by:

- QA Lead  
- Product Owner  
- Release Manager  

After completion, it serves as a reference point for post-release monitoring and defect tracing.
